My third project for FlatIron School was a beast in disguise.  Going in to it I knew it would be a challenge. I think I was a little spoiled by the Sinatra project. Sinatra is light weight and simple and a lot less features. That build was pretty smooth.

Rails offers a myriad of options and features that can make a project get away from you without even realizing it. 

The requirements were to build a CRUD based content management app.  I decided to build a book management app for users to keep track of their books while discovering new books other users have posted.

I think my biggest take away was learning to be happy about receiving a new error. I would get stuck on one specific error. It seemed no matter what I did that error wouldn't go away. So when I finally made the error change I got super excited. For me it meant I was headed in a direction of fixing that error and getting a piece of code to work. It was almost like following a trail of breadcrumbs. Also when you are stuck on a certain error you tend to remember it, how to avoid it and if you can't avoid you will know how to fix it in the future. 

It is almost feels like behavioral modification. The frustration makes you strive to be better and assimilate that error into a lesson in order to improve your skills.

Just learn to embrace and invite new errors.
